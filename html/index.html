                    <p>We are a FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) team in the Tri-Valley, California. 
                        The Tri-Valley area is comprised of San Ramon, Pleasanton, and Dublin. 
                        We consist of members from a multitude of schools around the community. 
                        In total, our team currently consists of 10 permanent members and 3 interns. 
                        For the 2019 - 2020 season, we have accepted several new interns as well!

                    <p>FIRST is a meaningful life experience. 
                        Outreach events develop confidence and public speaking skills. 
                        Members will learn how to assemble a robot together, and in the process you can learn many hardware skills for future use. 
                        All of the team members will help you improve. You may even have the chance to host a team meeting!

                    <p>According to a research done by Brandeis University, they found that kids that join FTC are two times more likely to show gains in stem interest! 
                        More than 90% of FTC's students got better at conflict resolution, problem solving, and time management! Read more at

                The first group we talked to was other more experienced teams. 
                    We invited them over to our meetings and asked them questions. 
                    We also recorded the answers and information for further use. 
                    The second group we talked to was the neighbors when we sold cookies. 
                    We sold the cookies, informed them of FIRST, and received friendly advice. 
                    The third group was total strangers (at least for most of us). 
                    We asked them for donations and told them about FTC.  
                    Those were the most successful types of outreach we've done so far. 
                    Not only were we able to gain money, but we were able to spread information of 
                    FTC very efficiently since there will always be people there.

                Our first outreach of the 2019-2020 season was when we went to Emerald Glen Park on 
                    May 11th 2019 to show little kids about our robots. In the duration of the presentations to the wandering children,  
                    we had a few people go and ask for donations for a fundraiser. We taught the kids about FTC and what our robot is designed to 
                    do. Then, we let kids try out our robot. During this event, we also had another fundraiser . 
                    Using one of out team members delicious home made sugar cookies, we sold them around the neighborhood near Emerald Glen Park.
                    Then, as it was the day before Mother's Day, another one of our team member decided to make  laser engraved picture 
                    frames for Mother's Day to sell to the mothers around the neighborhood. To the right, you may see an activity organizer for the event.
