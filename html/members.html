                    <h2>Anirud Lappathi</h2>

                    <p>A ninth grader at California High School, I am passionate about software and coding my own software or games for fun. I developed the website and helped my parents with a bit of their UI.</p>

                    <h2>Andrew Xiong</h2>

                    <p>I am a freshman at California High School. I joined the team because I wanted to pursue educational opportunities in STEM. I enjoy music and reading.</p>


                    <h2>Jada King</h2>

                    <p>An eighth grader at Challenger Ardenwood, I joined Turbo V8 after I graduated First Lego League with the Alphabots. I am passionate about drawing (comics) and graphic design, and I enjoy working with computers.</p>

                    <h2>Gavin Li</h2>

                    <p>I am an eighth grader at Gale Ranch Middle School. I hope to expose myself to this beautiful world of technology and immerse myself in hardware and software learning.</p>


                    <h2>Brycen Liu</h2>

                    <p>An 8th grader at Gale Ranch Middle School, I joined Turbo V8 after watching a robotics documentary. I am interested in computer hardware, robotics, and basketball.</p>


                    <h2>Michael Liu</h2>

                    <p>As an 7th grader at Pleasanton Middle School, I am very interested in robotics and building things from scratch. I hope to not only improve on hardware and software skills, but also public speaking and leadership skills in Turbo V8.</p>

                    <h2>Kelly Wang</h2>

                    <p>With a knack for design and creation, I joined Turbo V8 as an eighth grader at Challenger Ardenwood. I love to draw digitally (and on paper too) and read comics in my free time, and I really detest science - physics to be specific.</p>

                    <h2>Cindy Wu</h2>

                    <p>I have an interest in archery, taking it competitively, and started less than two years ago up until now as an eighth grader. One of my hobbies is stargazing, but I also love coding. After joining this robots team, I tried to learn Java, and I’m glad I did.</p>

                    <h2>Ryan Xu</h2>

                    <p>My mom once said “You have to get into da good correge.” This statement has motivated me to join a robotics team to gain experience for the future. I am an 8th grader at Fallon Middle school and I hope this robotics team will help me develop skills like building and programming.</p>


                    <h2>Davey Yu</h2>

                    <p>I am an 8th grader at Windemere Ranch Middle School. I am an unusual person with almost uncontrollable emotions, a great memory and a dedicated love in Robotics and Memes. My interest in Robotics led me to talking about TurbΩV8. I like chess, video games (I hope to create one myself), and doing anything cringy.</p>


                    <h2>Nicholas Zeng</h2>

                    <p>I joined this robotics team because I wanted to compete and to learn how to code. I was first inspired to join this when I volunteered at a competition and experienced it firsthand. Since I do not have any leadership skills, I hope that joining this team will help me gain more. In school, I enjoy subjects such math and science (STEM), but do not take much interest in writing, reading, and history. I recently started learning programming languages such as Python and Java, which will help me in robotics.</p>

                    <h2>Sharon Zhu</h2>

                    <p>I am an eighth grader at Iron Horse Middle School in San Ramon, and I am interested in science, math, and art. I joined this team to improve my communication and mechanical skills.</p>

                    <h2>Andrew Wu</h2>

                    <p>I am a junior in Dublin high and I want to join FTC to gain coding experience and gain experience in working with others.</p>

                    <h2>Eric Wang</h2>

                    <p>Computer science is one of my most favorite pastimes. I code for coding competitions (USA Computing Olympiad), robotics, and I do my own projects. I am currently a 9th grader from Dougherty Valley High School. I hope to gain more technical experience in both hardware and software.</p>
