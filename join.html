                    If you live near the Tri-Valley community and have a passion for robotics,
                    TurbΩ V8 may be the perfect opportunity for you! FIRST rules mandate that participants have to be 7th to 12th graders.
                    But don't worry! FIRST provides a multitude of programs for students with the desire to learn and succeed.
                    People of all skill levels are welcomed and needed. However, new members must participate in an interview before joining.

                <h3>Member Interview</h3>
                <p>People that wish to join our team are required to go through a short interview taking about 5 - 10 minutes.
                    After the interview process, people will be required to participate as "interns" for a few months before the team members
                    will decide whether to officially accept.
                </p>
                <p>Some examples of this are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Why do you want to join our team?</li>
                    <li>What do you hope to gain from this robotics experience?</li>
                    <li>What is your biggest weakness? How does it apply to your life, and how will you overcome this obstacle?</li>
