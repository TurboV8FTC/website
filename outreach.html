                        The first group we talked to was other more experienced teams.
                        We invited them over to our meetings and asked them questions.
                        We also recorded the answers and information for further use.
                        The second group we talked to was the neighbors when we sold cookies.
                        We sold the cookies, informed them of FIRST, and received friendly advice.
                        The third group was total strangers (at least for most of us).
                        We asked them for donations and told them about FTC.
                        Those were the most successful types of outreach we've done so far.
                        Not only were we able to gain money, but we were able to spread information of
                        FTC very efficiently since there will always be people there.

                        Our first outreach of the 2019-2020 season was when we went to Emerald Glen Park on
                        May 11th 2019 to show little kids about our robots. In the duration of the presentations to the wandering children,
                        we had a few people go and ask for donations for a fundraiser. We taught the kids about FTC and what our robot is designed to
                        do. Then, we let kids try out our robot. During this event, we also had another fundraiser .
                        Using one of out team members delicious home made sugar cookies, we sold them around the neighborhood near Emerald Glen Park.
                        Then, as it was the day before Mother's Day, another one of our team member decided to make laser engraved picture
                        frames for Mother's Day to sell to the mothers around the neighborhood. To the right, you may see an activity organizer for the event.

                        A recent outreach that we have done was selling cherries in one of our team member's neighborhood. That team member had a few cherry trees in his backyard and we decided that we could sell fresh picked cherries to fund-raise. So, we split up into teams of two each going into different sections of the neighborhood, giving out fliers advertising FTC, celebrating Father's day, and selling cherries.

                        Another outreach that we have done was explaining what FTC was and our robot at a summer camp called Home Of The Christ. There, we had a presentation to young kids, consisting of elementary school students, which many were eager to learn more about our robot and how it functioned.
                        Some team members attended an outreach event in a church's summer camp, where we helped a robotics teacher teach the kids about mBot, an educational robot designed to help kids learn about robotics. Having one teacher teach a whole group of kids mBot was very challenging, so our team helped out. We would help with the hardware process, fix kids' coding issues, or a problem that they were struggling on.
