## About Our Team

We are a First Tech Challenge (FTC) team located around the Tri-Valley. We've already completed one season and are planning to continue with another, which is why we have decided to create a website in order to give more information about ourselves, and our team. 

## For anyone working on the website:

1) Make sure to commit your changes properly
2) Check whether your code works before committing
3) Place the right code in the right folders (i.e html in the "html" folder)
