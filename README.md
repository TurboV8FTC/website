# Team #14259 TurbÎ© V8 Website Source Code

## About

We are a First Tech Challenge (FTC) team located around the Tri-Valley. We've already completed one season and are planning to continue with another, which is why we have decided to create a website in order to give more information about ourselves, and our team. This website is coded using html, css, and JavaScript.

### Note:
We moved the files from a pre-existing branch, html, to the master branch, which is why it seems as if there are no commits.
